## Education

- B. Tech. (Honors) in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iith.ac.in), 2015 - 2019<br>
  [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in)

## Projects

### FM and LP based UTVPI Over Approximation

Algorithms for finding tight UTVPI (octagonal) over-approximations of polyhedra using linear programming and Fourier-Motzkin eliminations.

[GitHub](https://github.com/IITH-Compilers/UTVPI-OA)

### Open-WBO-Inc MaxSAT Solver

Open-WBO-Inc is an incomplete MaxSAT solver based on the top Open-WBO with approximation strategies proposed in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-98334-9_15.pdf).
At MaxSAT Evaluation 2018, Open-WBO-Inc got 1st place in incomplete weighted track with 60s timeout and 2nd place in incomplete weighted track with 300s timeout.
The results are available [here](https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/2018/rankings.html).
At MaxSAT Evaluation 2019, Open-WBO-Inc got 3rd place in incomplete weighted track with 60s and 300s timeout. The results are available [here](https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/2019/rankings.html).

### Timetabler

Timetabler generates a timetable given a set of inputs and constraints.
It encodes constraints of the timetabling problem as a SAT formula in the Conjunctive Normal Form and then calls a MaxSAT solver to solve the problem.
It is currently used by IIT Hyderabad to schedule timetable for courses.
